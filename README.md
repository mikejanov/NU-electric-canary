Branch Management Style
-----------------------
-->Release Branch
---->Beta Branch
------>Developer 1
------>Developer 2
...

On Developer branch, commit history can be as verbose as desired. When merging code with the Beta branch, clone Developer to new branch and make feature-driven commits, as needed.
